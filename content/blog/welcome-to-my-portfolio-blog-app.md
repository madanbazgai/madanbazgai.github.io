# 🤔What is it about?

- This is my personal Portfolio/Blog app.
- This app is powered by the technologies such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), PWA etc.

# 👉What is Hugo?

- Hugo is the fastest static-site generator powered by Googles's Go programming language.
- By default it ships only HTML which makes website faster.

# 👉What is PWA ?

- PWA stands for Progressive Web Apps.
- It is a way of turning the existing **web-apps** into **native-like app** with some native capabilities.
- The app can be installed on both **Smartphone** and **Desktop**.
- The app can work **Offline** and the users donot have to update app. (They are automatically updated on refresh)

# 💚100% LightHouse Score.💪

- Being static site, on ideal condition it has 100% lighthouse score on performance, accessibility, SEO and PWA.
- This may vary, depending upon **browser** and **installed-extensions**.

# 😎What did I do here?

- I fully designed, customized and developed this app.
- This app is inspired by the Hugo theme called 'papermod' and the Nothing OS font.
- This app has modern features such as:
  - [x] Dark/Light Mode
  - [x] Installable
  - [x] Offline Capability
  - [x] Search ... and so much more

# ✉️ What can you do here?.
