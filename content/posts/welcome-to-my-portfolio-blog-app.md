# 🤔What is it about?

- This is my personal Portfolio/Blog app.
- **Contents** are 100% original.
- It is based on my **original idea**, inspired by some **open-source techs**, not copied from someones projects, neither it's Wordpress/Wix's 5 minutes knock-off.
- This app is powered by the technologies such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), PWA etc.

# ✉️ What can you do here?.

- Well the first thing you can do is **install** this app, **by clicking** on my **name** on the **top of the page**.
- Follow me on github and other social-platform.
- You can read articles.
- You can suggest changes.
- You can comment to the blog post.

# 😎What did I do?

- I fully designed, customized and developed this app.
- This app is inspired by the Hugo theme called 'papermod' and the Nothing OS font.
- I wanted to make this app to have modern features such as:
  - [x] Dark/Light Mode
  - [x] Installable
  - [x] Offline Capability
  - [x] Search ... and so much more
- This app took lots of time specially for optimizations.

# 👉What the hell is Hugo?

- Hugo is the fastest static-site generator powered by Googles's Go programming language.
- By default it ships only HTML which makes website faster.

# 👉What is PWA ?

- PWA stands for Progressive Web Apps.
- It is a way of turning the existing **web-apps** into **native-like app** with some native capabilities.
- The app can be installed on both **Smartphone** and **Desktop**.
- The app can work **Offline** and the users donot have to update app. (They are automatically updated on refresh)

# 💚100% LightHouse Score? Hell Yeah💪

- On ideal condition.
- The screenshot is mentioned above.
- With lots of efforts, headaches and optimization i was finally able to achieve this score.
- This may vary depending upon your **browser** and **installed-extensions**.

# 💚 THANK YOU 💚
